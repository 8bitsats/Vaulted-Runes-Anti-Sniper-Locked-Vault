Introduction

The Anti-Bot Vault mechanism is designed to protect token launches from sniper bots and ensure a fairer distribution of tokens among genuine supporters. 
This mechanism helps to mitigate the negative impact of bots, which often buy large quantities of tokens at launch, disadvantaging real users and supporters.

The Problem with Sniper Bots During a token launch, sniper bots have an unfair advantage as they can:

Purchase a substantial portion of the token supply at very low prices.
Cause tokens to be held by a few entities looking for quick profits.
Inflate token prices immediately after the launch, leading to dissatisfied users and a distorted market value.
These scenarios hinder the fair distribution of tokens and negatively affect the project's reputation and community building.

The vault is whitelisted to buy tokens from the pool before the activation slot.
Vault users can purchase tokens at the earliest (and likely lowest) price before sniper bots can access them.

Fairer Distribution:
All vault users receive tokens at the same average price.
The amount of tokens received is proportional to the USDC

The Problem with Sniper Bots

During a token launch, sniper bots have an unfair advantage as they can:
	•	Purchase a substantial portion of the token supply at very low prices.
	•	Cause tokens to be held by a few entities looking for quick profits.
	•	Inflate token prices immediately after the launch, leading to dissatisfied users and a distorted market value.
 
These scenarios hinder the fair distribution of tokens and negatively affect the project's reputation and community building.

Anti-Bot Solution for Genuine Supporters

Meteora’s new anti-bot vault is specially designed to tackle this token launch problem by enabling any user to be the first buyers of the token. 
Projects can configure the vault parameters so that tokens are locked up for a day or more and later vested for a short period, e.g., 30 days.

Key Features

	1	First-to-Purchase Ability:
	•	The vault is whitelisted to buy tokens from the pool before the activation slot.
	•	Vault users can buy the token at the earliest (and likely lowest) price before the activation slot and thus before sniper bots.
	2	Fairer Distribution:
	•	All vault users get their tokens at the same average price.
	•	The amount of tokens received is proportional to their share of the total amount of USDC deposited.
	3	Configurable Token Lock-Up Period:
	•	Projects can configure vault parameters such that tokens bought by the vault are locked and subsequently vested for a few days.
	•	This encourages purchase by genuine supporters of the project, as they are more willing to hold their tokens for a day or so longer.
 
Vault Customization Options for Projects

Projects like UpRock who use the Alpha Vault for token launches have the flexibility to tailor vault parameters to suit their specific launch requirements, such as:

	•	Setting maximum purchase limits.
	•	Defining the lock-up and vesting periods for users.
 
How to Use the Vault

Step 1: Deposit USDC into the Vault
Deposit During the Deposit Period:

	•	Navigate to the left section of the page to access the anti-bot vault.
	•	Click the “Deposit USDC” button to begin.
	•	Use the slider tool or type in the exact USDC amount you wish to deposit into the vault.
	•	You can only deposit USDC during the deposit period, and a timer at the bottom shows a countdown to the end of the deposit period.
 
Withdraw During the Deposit Period:
	•	After depositing USDC, you can choose to withdraw anytime before the end of the deposit period.
 
Note:
	•	Average vault price changes based on total USDC deposited in the vault and total token amount that would be acquired.
	•	Estimated discount % from launch price assumes the vault acquires its max token allocation. 
 This discount % changes depending on how close TVL is to the Vault Max Cap.
 
Step 2: Withdrawing Unused USDC
	•	Once the deposit period ends, you can no longer deposit more USDC or withdraw your earlier deposit.
	•	The vault becomes active and will begin using the USDC collected to buy tokens from the pool.
	•	All vault users get their tokens at the same average price, and the amount of tokens received is proportional to your share of the total amount of USDC deposited.
 
What Happens if TVL Exceeds Vault Max Cap?
	•	If the TVL in the vault exceeds the max cap the vault can buy from the pool, unused USDC will be returned to you and you can withdraw them anytime once the vault token acquisition period is over.
	•	For example, if you deposited 100 USDC and TVL in the vault is 10M USDC, 
 but the vault max cap is 1M USDC, only 1/10th of your USDC deposit will be used to purchase tokens. 90 USDC from your 100 USDC deposit will be unused and returned to you.
 
Step 3: Claim Tokens After the Lock Period
	•	Some time after the launch of the pool, locked tokens in the vault start vesting over a few days.
	•	The exact slot where tokens get unlocked and vested depends on the token project, who can configure the parameters based on their needs.
	•	You can claim unlocked tokens anytime!
 
Benefits of Locking Tokens

Increased Liquidity
	•	By locking tokens for a certain period, it ensures that tokens are not immediately dumped on the market. 
 This creates a more stable market environment with increased liquidity as tokens are gradually released.
 
Enhanced Value

	•	Locking tokens signals to the market that the holders are committed to the project for the long term. 
 This can positively impact the token’s value as it reduces immediate sell pressure and fosters a more stable and supportive community.
Alignment with Genuine Supporters

	•	Genuine supporters are more likely to hold tokens for a longer period, aligning their interests with the project’s long-term success. 
 This helps in building a loyal community that is vested in the project's growth and stability.
We believe the Alpha Vault can be a great tool for all token launches, ensuring a fairer distribution and better market conditions.
Please note that the vault is a new feature in Beta, so do your own research (DYOR) and stay informed about its developments.
